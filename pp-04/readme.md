# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/app-architecture/navigation/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
For this I want to keep the flat navigation it currently has, as it helps to have different "tabs"
to different things students may need.
I also want them to be able to tap different important tools but not have to navigate
the current website, more of a column based design, each time one of these is tapped
the box will enlarge instead of taking them to a different page.
* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
I wanted to implement the auto layout from the I phone HCI to implement a simpler
layout while still having the iit alert on the bottom of the login because I think
most users of the website just want to log in and it is very hard to
tap on the login elements to login.
I want to push the alert underneath the login so that it is still there just not in
the way.
* HCI Guidline Three (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/controls/page-controls/
* For photo one I would also implement page controls to slide through different
boxes instead of having to scroll down. I would do this because as is there
are so many boxes with needless information that the user would have to scroll down.
Many people would prefer to scroll side to side from 2-3 pages max. This would also help
Keep pages more modular as instead of having to constantly add lets say flex box to adjust
all the box dimensions, having only 3 boxes per page swiped may keep things more
easily aligned.
