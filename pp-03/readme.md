1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13v0u0kp8ta9lK+iuyWsZqSvQdg
Your Rationale: I chose this pallet because when looking at other platforms like
Xbox, Steam, And PlayStation one thing stood out. They all have little contrast on there menu
button. In my gaming platform I went with cool blue because I want them to be "chill"
when on my gaming platform because I feel it should be a relaxed gamin environment, while
providing high contrast when selecting tabs to make things easier ie buying games, playing a game,
browsing the menu

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=51V0T0kp8ta9lK+iuyWsZqSvQdg
Your Rationale: For this pallet I opted for green yellow over green and blue. This is because
yellow is more of an active color to entice the user into feeling more attentive to the information
I provide. The cool blue may not be as enticing and feel more mellow. I would go for a hard yellow
on tabs and green for other body backgrounds so the yellow is not as overpowering.
The green still provides the spring feel as green relates to life.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=34Y0T0kpjud9lK+l7DYlZqvtriD
Your Rationale: For this pallet I took inspiration from my childhood, Barney.
I want the colors to be fun, enticing, and welcoming to little kids. Lighter shades
of each color are great and but with enough dimness that they won't hurt there
developing eyes. For learning the alphabet having a shade of yellow for the letters
they will be learning or having it as a background may help with there attention.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=73E0T0kc1H-50fsk9lA4Gkukgst
Your Rationale: I went with this pallet because I think the green on black for anything tech
related is over-done. I went with a plain beige for a clean simple look.
A cool blue for the background, the yellow for tabes or menues and grey's and blacks for
text with purples to make the user feel like there is always something to look at.
The blue will help keep the user calm and hopefully make the website easy to navigate.
